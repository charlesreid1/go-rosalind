# Go-Rosalind

Solving problems from Rosalind.info using Go

## Quick Start

Most chapter folders are structured to run with
go test, so run the following command in each
chapter directory:

```
go test -v
```

## Organization

To best organize code, we write functions to
solve each problem, and put the functions into
a single Go file, `rosalind.go`.

This way, all functions for all prior problems
can be utilized.
